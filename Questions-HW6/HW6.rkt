 QUESTION 1

PART A)
   Three features of Lisp that Graham believes gave
his company a competitive advantage were one lisp is a
good language for writing software quickly, two lisp
has the most powerful macros because it has "no syntax"
and three Lisp is so high level that they didnt have to
hire a big development team which saved them money

PART B)
   The two observations that we found to be the most interesting
were the Blub paradox and that computer hardware changes so much
faster than personal habits.
   The Blub paradox is when a programmer
is devoted to a certain langauge so much so that they think all
languages are either not worth learning because they are satisfied
with their langauge or too simplistic because it does not support
features that their langauge does. Essentially they can't imagine
a language more powerful than their own because the more powerful
languages aren't considered to be more powerful just different and
the less powerful languages to be too simplistic. We found this
observation to be significant because it displays the foolishness
of being monolingual when it comes to programming.
   Graham's observation that computer hardware changes so much
faster than personal habits means that the full capabilities of a
new language or hardware is never implemented until many years later.
And this is because people are unwilling or incapable of switching
their habits to the new capabilities. We found this to be a
significant observation because it stresses the abiility to adapt
being a programmer, it is similar to how being monolingual is
foolish but instead focuses more on the premise of being unable
to change and mold as a programmer is foolish.

 QUESTION 2
____________________

 Three questions that Graham teaches to ask when approaching a new
language are "who is this programmed designed for?" "how many people
were behind its creation?" and "why are people using it?"
If the answer to these questions are "for large organizations and thus
best for a wide range of skilled programmers," "more than a small group
who developed the language for their own use" and "because their bosses
are telling them to or they hear its great from the press" respectively
than the langauge is likely to not be successful. Good langauges are
instead limitless to the programmer and not designed to be easy. They
should be made because it would better serve the creators: had function
and finally it should be used because programmers love it not because
they are forced to use it or influenced to.
